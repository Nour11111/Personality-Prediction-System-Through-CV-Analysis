# Personality-Prediction-System-Through-CV-Analysis
This project is a Personality Prediction System that uses resume analysis and user answers to predict personality traits.

## Overview

The Personality Prediction System is designed to predict personality traits by analyzing user-provided resumes and their answers to personality-related questions.

The system comprises two main components:
1. **Training the Model:** A script to preprocess and train a machine learning model on labeled data.
2. **Web Application:** A Flask-based web interface where users can provide their resume and answer personality questions to receive predicted personality traits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install required packages - Flask - joblib - pandas - scikit-learn - nltk
You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install flask joblib pandas scikit-learn nltk


## Web Application

The web application uses Flask to create a user interface for predicting personality traits.

1. Run `app.py`: Launches the Flask application and sets up routes for the web interface.

2. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to access the application.
